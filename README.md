# Usage
Find a time slot to enter a task. Click the 'edit' button to the right to allow text editing of the time block. After entering text, click the 'edit' button again to save. All time slots are color-coded. Gray means the hour has passed, red represents the present hour and green is the future.

# What I learned

This project was my first time using the moment.js library. This simple and intuitive library allowed me to find the current time and date. Using moment.js I was able to configure the colorizing functionality and render the current date at the top of the page.

The biggest challenge I faced with this project was working with the AM/PM time format. With a 24-hour time format, it's easy to loop through the hours and impliment functionality. With 2 12-hour blocks it added a layer of complexity I wasn't expecting.
